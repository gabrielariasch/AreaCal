# AreaCal

The code is a Python program that calculates the number of cans of paint needed to paint a wall. The program first imports the math module, which provides a number of mathematical functions. The program then prompts the user for the height and width of the wall, and the number of square feet of coverage per can of paint. The program then uses the math module to calculate the number of cans of paint needed, and prints the result.
